            <p class="article-text">Rosa Bonheur
                (1822–1899) was a French artist, painter of animals, and sculptor, known for her artistic
                realism. Born
                in Bordeaux into a family of artists, she moved to Paris at the age of six. Spending much of her time
                drawing from
                an early age, Bonheur had a difficult childhood and was expelled from several schools, eventually being
                trained as
                a painter by her father. A French government commission led to Bonheur's first great success, Ploughing
                in the
                Nivernais, exhibited in 1849. In 1855 she completed The Horse Fair, which is regarded as her most
                famous work.

                by American
                artist
                Anna
                Elizabeth Klumpke, a long-time admirer of Bonheur's work.
